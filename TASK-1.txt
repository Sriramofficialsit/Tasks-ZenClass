Write a blog on Difference between HTTP1.1 vs HTTP2

HTTP/1.1:

1.Uses separate connections for each resource, leading to potential bottlenecks.
2.Headers are not compressed, causing overhead.
3.No built-in support for server push.
4.No prioritization of resources, potentially slowing down page load times.
5.Errors can interrupt the entire page loading process.

HTTP/2:

1.Uses a single connection for multiple resources, reducing latency.
2.Compresses headers, reducing overhead.
3.Supports server push, improving performance.
4.Prioritizes resources, speeding up page load times.
5.Errors are isolated, minimizing impact on other resources.
